        "With a name refering to the Velvet Underground and having original songs inspired by american music from the 60's, 70's as a mean of expression, some people might say that these seven young musicians from the Paris stage are not in phase with their era.",
        "But music spreads beyond time, and that has been well understood by the $26 In My Hand. In their opinion, the only thing that matters is to create a music that is in harmony with them, capable of affecting the public with its authenticity.",
        "Euphorized by the stage, it is during lives that the $26 In My Hand reveal their real potential, bringing a whole new dimension to their music."
